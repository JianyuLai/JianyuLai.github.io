I am a postdoctoral associate at the University of Maryland, College Park, with a passion for advancing the prevention and control of airborne infectious diseases. My research focuses on understanding respiratory viral infections like COVID-19 and influenza to develop innovative strategies for protecting public health. With a background in epidemiology and a commitment to interdisciplinary collaboration, I aim to contribute to a healthier and more resilient global community.
