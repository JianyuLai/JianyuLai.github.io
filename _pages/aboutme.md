Hello! My name is Jianyu Lai (赖建妤), and I am a postdoctoral associate at the Public Health AeroBiology Laboratory (PHAB Lab) at the University of Maryland, College Park. My work focuses on the epidemiology of acute respiratory infections, particularly the prevention and control of respiratory viral infections such as COVID-19 and influenza. I strive to connect rigorous epidemiological research with practical approaches to promote healthier communities.

I hold a PhD in Epidemiology from the University of Maryland, where I explored exhaled breath aerosol transmission of acute respiratory infections under the guidance of Dr. Donald Milton. Prior to this, I earned a Master of Public Health in Epidemiology and a graduate certificate in Health Informatics from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My journey in public health began with a Bachelor of Medicine in Preventive Medicine from Sun Yat-Sen University, China, where I built a strong foundation in understanding and addressing public health challenges.

I am deeply interested in uncovering the factors that drive the spread of acute respiratory infections and identifying effective strategies to reduce risks. My research has spanned diverse settings, including observational studies in college communities and a controlled human transmission trial conducted in a quarantine facility. Through these studies, I hope to contribute to meaningful advancements in public health.
