Hello! My name is Jianyu Lai (赖建妤), and I am a postdoctoral associate at the *Public Health AeroBiology Laboratory (PHAB Lab)* at the University of Maryland, College Park. My work focuses on the epidemiology of acute respiratory infections, particularly the prevention and control of respiratory viral infections such as COVID-19 and influenza. I strive to connect rigorous epidemiological research with practical approaches to promote healthier communities.

I hold a PhD in Epidemiology from the University of Maryland, where I explored exhaled breath aerosol transmission of acute respiratory infections under the guidance of Dr. Donald Milton. Prior to this, I earned a Master of Public Health in Epidemiology and a graduate certificate in Health Informatics from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My journey in public health began with a Bachelor of Medicine in Preventive Medicine from Sun Yat-Sen University, China, where I built a strong foundation in understanding and addressing public health challenges.

I am dedicated to researching the transmission and prevention of acute respiratory infections, aiming to reduce their impact on communities. My research has spanned diverse settings, including observational studies in a college community and a controlled human transmission trial conducted in a quarantine facility. Through these studies, I hope to contribute to meaningful advancements in public health.
